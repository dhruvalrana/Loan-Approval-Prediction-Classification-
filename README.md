Loan Approval Prediction
This repository contains machine learning models built using Python to predict loan approval status based on applicant data. It includes implementations of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers.

üìÅ Files Included
Loan_Approval_Prediction.csv: Dataset containing loan application records.

decision_tree_loan_approval_prediction.py: Implementation using Decision Tree Classifier.

logistic_regression_Loan_Approval_Prediction.py: Implementation using Logistic Regression.

random_forest_loan_approval_prediction.py: Implementation using Random Forest Classifier.

üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

loan_id: Unique loan identifier

applicant_income, coapplicant_income, loan_amount, loan_term: Numerical features

gender, married, dependents, education, self_employed, property_area, etc.: Categorical features

loan_status: Target variable (Approved, Rejected)

üß† Models Used
Decision Tree

Categorical encoding via LabelEncoder

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, confusion matrix

Visualizes confusion matrix and tree

Logistic Regression

Encoding + feature standardization (StandardScaler)

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Log Loss

Includes ROC Curve

Random Forest

Feature importance plot

Visualization of a single decision tree from the ensemble
