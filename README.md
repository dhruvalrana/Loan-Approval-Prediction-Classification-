# Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains machine learning models built using Python to predict loan approval status based on applicant data. It includes implementations of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest classifiers.

## üìÅ Files Included

* `Loan_Approval_Prediction.csv`: Dataset containing loan application records.
* `decision_tree_loan_approval_prediction.py`: Implementation using Decision Tree Classifier.
* `logistic_regression_Loan_Approval_Prediction.py`: Implementation using Logistic Regression.
* `random_forest_loan_approval_prediction.py`: Implementation using Random Forest Classifier.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

* `loan_id`: Unique loan identifier
* `applicant_income`, `coapplicant_income`, `loan_amount`, `loan_term`: Numerical features
* `gender`, `married`, `dependents`, `education`, `self_employed`, `property_area`, etc.: Categorical features
* `loan_status`: Target variable (`Approved`, `Rejected`)

## üß† Models Used

1. **Decision Tree**

   * Categorical encoding via `LabelEncoder`
   * Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, confusion matrix
   * Visualizes confusion matrix and tree

2. **Logistic Regression**

   * Encoding + feature standardization (`StandardScaler`)
   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Log Loss
   * Includes ROC Curve

3. **Random Forest**

   * Feature importance plot
   * Visualization of a single decision tree from the ensemble
